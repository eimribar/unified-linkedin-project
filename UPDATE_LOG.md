- ✅ Set chunk size warning limit to 600KB
- ✅ All builds complete successfully without errors

## Testing Results
- Build: ✅ Successful
- TypeScript: ✅ No errors
- Bundle optimization: ✅ Implemented code splitting

## Next Steps
- Monitor production performance after deployment
- Consider further optimizations if needed
- Address remaining security vulnerabilities in future update
